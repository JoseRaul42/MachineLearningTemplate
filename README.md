# **MachineLearningTemplate**

## Overview
This project features a suite of four interconnected Python scripts, each dedicated to a specific phase of the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. Designed for simplicity and efficiency, these scripts facilitate the extraction of data from databases, perform necessary transformations for machine learning readiness, load the data into a model for analysis or prediction, and include a script for loading test data into a database. This project is well-suited for a variety of machine learning applications, particularly those involving data-driven insights.

## 1. Data Extraction
**Functionality**: Extracts data from a specified database, ensuring a reliable and consistent data source for further processing.

**Features**:
  - Connects to and extracts data from databases efficiently.
  - Customizable to support various database systems.
  - Ensures data integrity during extraction.

**Use Case**: Ideal for projects requiring consistent and accurate data retrieval from databases, forming the foundation of data analysis pipelines.

## 2. Data Transformation
**Functionality**: Transforms extracted data, making it suitable for feeding into machine learning models.

**Features**:
  - Cleans, normalizes, and preprocesses data.
  - Enhances data quality and format for analytical processing.
  - Adaptable for different types of data transformation requirements.

**Use Case**: Essential for data scientists and analysts who need to prepare raw data for insightful analysis and machine learning model training.

## 3. Data Loading to Model
**Functionality**: Loads the transformed data into a machine learning model, facilitating the generation of outputs.

**Features**:
  - Seamlessly integrates with various machine learning models.
  - Ensures efficient data transfer and loading.
  - Supports a range of model types and frameworks.

**Use Case**: Perfect for machine learning practitioners looking to feed processed data into models for prediction, classification, or other analytical purposes.

## 4. CSV Test Data to Database 
**Functionality**: `csvtestdata2database.py` Automates the loading of provided test data into a specified database.

**Features**:
  - Automatically loads test data CSV files into the `SolanaHistorical` database.
  - Requires placing the CSV file in the `C:/temp` folder on your computer for initial setup.
  - Customizable file path and database name for different environments.

**Use Case**: Ideal for quickly setting up test environments or demonstrations, ensuring that the application has the necessary data for initial testing and evaluations.

## Technical Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Depending on the specific requirements (e.g., Pandas for data manipulation, SQLAlchemy for database interaction)
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: Compatible with various frameworks like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the ETL pipeline:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system.
   - Install necessary Python libraries as per your project's requirements.
   - Add the test CSV file to `C:/temp` and ensure a database named `SolanaHistorical`  is created for the `csvtestdata2database.py` script. 

2. **Running the Scripts**:
   - Configure each script according to your database and model specifications.
   - Execute the scripts in order: first data extraction, followed by transformation, loading into the model, and finally loading the test data.

## Contribution and Customization
This project is open for contributions and can be customized to fit a wide range of ETL needs in different machine learning contexts. You are encouraged to fork, modify, and adapt these scripts to meet your specific data processing and analysis requirements.
